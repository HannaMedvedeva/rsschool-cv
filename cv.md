3. I am 24 years old. Today I am an ophthalmologist, working in a Regional Clinical Hospital for Children, 1st year after my graduation from Belarusian State Medical University. 
Unfortunately, I was disappointed in our medical system, and after much thought made a decision to start learning programming. Last year I studied Java on my own about 5 mounth,
in present time I started learning JavaScript. I can study on my own, I am sure of this after studying 6 years at our medical university :) and I have good motivation to develop.
4. My skills: Java basics, JavaScript basics, HTML basics, OOP basics. 
5. Code examples: 
```
<script>
    function Calculator() {
        this.read = function () {
            this.x = +prompt("enter first number", "");
            this.y = +prompt("enter second number", "");
        };
        this.sum = function () {
            return this.x + this.y;
        };
        this.mul = function () {
            return this.x * this.y;
        }
    }
    let calculator = new Calculator();
    calculator.read();

    alert("Sum=" + calculator.sum());
    alert("Mul=" + calculator.mul());


    function Accumulator(startingValue) {
        this.read = function () {
            this.value += +prompt("enter a number", "");
        }
        this.value = +startingValue;
    }
    let accumulator = new Accumulator(1);

    accumulator.read();
    accumulator.read();

    alert(accumulator.value);
</script>
```
      
      
6. Experience: for today, is only a selfeducation programming (javarush, codewars.com , learn.javascript.ru , some tasks from my friends - developers :))
7. Education: BSMU, self education
8. English: B1, studied in school, university, self education.
