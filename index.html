        <p>I am 24 years old. Today I am an ophthalmologist,
            working in a Regional Clinical Hospital for Children,
            1st year after my graduation from Belarusian State
            Medical University. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I was disappointed in our medical system,
            and after much thought made a decision to start learning
            programming. Last year I studied Java on my own about 5
            month, It has now been about 6 months since I started learning JavaScript.
            I can study on my own, I am sure of this after studying 6
            years at our medical university :)
            and <b>have good motivation to develop</b> .</p>
        <div class="linebreak"></div>
        <p><b>My skills</b>: Java basics, JavaScript basics, HTML & CSS, SASS, GIT, OOP basics.</p>

        <p><b> Code examples</b>:</p>

        <div class="linebreak calc"></div>
        <p><b>Experience</b>: for today, is only a self education programming (rs-school 2020Q3, javarush, codewars.com,
            learn.javascript.ru, some tasks from my friends - developers :))</p>
        <p><b>Education</b>: BSMU, self education</p>
